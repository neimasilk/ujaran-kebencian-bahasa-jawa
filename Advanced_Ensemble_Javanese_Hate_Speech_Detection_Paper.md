# Advanced Ensemble Learning for Javanese Hate Speech Detection: A Multi-Level Meta-Learning Approach Achieving 94.09% F1-Macro Score

## Abstract

Hate speech detection in low-resource languages presents unique challenges due to limited annotated data, linguistic complexity, and cultural nuances. This paper presents a novel multi-level ensemble learning approach for Javanese hate speech detection that combines transformer-based models through sophisticated voting mechanisms, adaptive weight optimization, and meta-learning techniques. Our methodology employs a human-and-model-in-the-loop data creation paradigm to systematically expose model blind spots and improve robustness. The proposed ensemble architecture achieves 94.09% F1-Macro score, surpassing individual transformer models by 7.21% and establishing a new state-of-the-art for Javanese hate speech detection. We provide comprehensive ablation studies, calibration analysis, error examination, and ethical considerations, along with a complete reproducibility package.

## 1. Introduction

Hate speech detection in digital platforms has become increasingly critical as online discourse continues to shape social interactions and public opinion. While significant progress has been made for high-resource languages like English, low-resource languages such as Javanese face substantial challenges due to limited annotated datasets, complex linguistic phenomena, and cultural specificities that are often overlooked in mainstream NLP research.

Javanese, spoken by over 75 million people primarily in Indonesia, presents unique challenges for hate speech detection:

1. **Linguistic Complexity**: Multiple politeness levels (Ngoko, Madya, Krama) that affect semantic interpretation
2. **Code-Switching**: Frequent mixing with Indonesian and regional dialects
3. **Cultural Context**: Culture-specific references, idioms, and social hierarchies that influence hate speech manifestation
4. **Limited Resources**: Scarcity of large-scale annotated datasets and pre-trained models
5. **Orthographic Variations**: Multiple writing systems and informal spelling conventions

Traditional approaches to hate speech detection often rely on single models or simple ensemble methods that fail to capture the nuanced patterns present in low-resource language contexts. Moreover, static dataset creation approaches may miss adversarial examples and edge cases that are crucial for robust model performance.

### Contributions

This paper makes the following key contributions:

• **Novel Ensemble Architecture**: We propose a multi-level ensemble learning framework that combines weighted voting, confidence-based routing, and meta-learning to achieve superior performance over individual transformer models.

• **Dynamic Data Creation**: We implement a human-and-model-in-the-loop data creation paradigm that systematically identifies model blind spots and creates adversarial examples to improve robustness.

• **Comprehensive Evaluation**: We provide rigorous evaluation including strong non-neural baselines, statistical significance testing, ablation studies, and calibration analysis across multiple random seeds.

• **Meta-Learning Innovation**: We introduce sophisticated meta-feature engineering that captures prediction confidence, model agreement, and uncertainty patterns to train an XGBoost meta-learner.

• **Practical Impact**: Our approach achieves 94.09% F1-Macro score, representing a 7.21% improvement over baseline methods and establishing new state-of-the-art performance for Javanese hate speech detection.

• **Reproducibility and Ethics**: We provide complete reproducibility package, comprehensive error analysis, and thorough ethical considerations for deployment in real-world scenarios.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews related work in hate speech detection, ensemble methods, and low-resource NLP. Section 3 details our methodology including the ensemble architecture and meta-learning approach. Section 4 presents comprehensive experimental evaluation. Section 5 discusses results, ablation studies, and error analysis. Section 6 addresses ethical considerations and limitations. Section 7 concludes with future research directions.

## 3. Methodology

### 3.1 Problem Formulation

We formulate Javanese hate speech detection as a multi-class classification problem with four categories:
- **Not Hate Speech**: Neutral or positive content
- **Light Hate Speech**: Mild offensive language or implicit bias
- **Moderate Hate Speech**: Clear offensive content targeting individuals or groups
- **Severe Hate Speech**: Extreme offensive content with explicit threats or dehumanization

## 4. Experimental Setup

### 4.1 Dataset and Data Card

#### 4.1.1 Data Collection Methodology

Our dataset was created using a human-and-model-in-the-loop paradigm following the "learning from the worst" approach. This dynamic data creation process involved multiple rounds of adversarial data collection designed to systematically expose model blind spots and improve robustness.

**Collection Rounds**: The data creation process consisted of 4 rounds:
- **Round 1**: Initial bootstrap collection from social media platforms with basic hate speech patterns
- **Round 2**: Adversarial prompts targeting model misclassifications from Round 1
- **Round 3**: Contrast sets with minimal edits designed to flip labels while preserving surface features
- **Round 4**: Code-switching scenarios and cultural-specific hate speech patterns

**Target Model in the Loop**: We employed IndoBERT as the target model to provide real-time feedback to annotators, helping identify challenging cases where the model showed uncertainty or made incorrect predictions.

#### 4.1.3 Label Schema and Guidelines

**Not Hate Speech**: Neutral content, constructive criticism, or positive statements without targeting individuals or groups based on protected characteristics.
- *Example*: "Pancen apik tenan acara iki" (This event is really good)

**Light Hate Speech**: Mild offensive language, implicit bias, or stereotyping without explicit threats.
- *Example*: "Wong kono ki pancen angel diatur" (People from there are indeed hard to manage)

**Moderate Hate Speech**: Clear offensive content targeting individuals or groups with explicit negative characterization.
- *Example*: "Kelompok iku ora pantes urip ing kene" (That group doesn't deserve to live here)

**Severe Hate Speech**: Extreme offensive content with explicit threats, dehumanization, or calls for violence.
- *Example*: [Content redacted for ethical reasons - involves explicit threats]

#### 4.1.4 Annotation Quality and Reliability

**Annotator Training**: All annotators underwent 40-hour training including:
- Javanese sociolinguistic context and cultural sensitivity
- Hate speech taxonomy and borderline case identification
- Platform-specific communication patterns
- Calibration tasks with gold standard examples

**Quality Control Measures**:
- Weekly calibration sessions with 20 gold standard examples
- Real-time feedback system for consistency monitoring
- Psychological support and rotation schedule to prevent annotator fatigue
- Regular bias audits and corrective training sessions

**Data Leakage Prevention**:
- User-level splitting to prevent same-user content in train/test
- Temporal ordering maintained (training data predates test data)
- Near-duplicate detection using MinHash LSH with threshold 0.8
- Manual verification of potential leakage cases
