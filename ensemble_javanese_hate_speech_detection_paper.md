# Human-and-Model-in-the-Loop Ensemble Learning for Javanese Hate Speech Detection: A Sociolinguistically-Informed Approach

## Abstract

We present a **human-and-model-in-the-loop (HMIL)** approach for Javanese hate speech detection that integrates sociolinguistic features with a stacked transformer ensemble. Across four HMIL rounds with expert annotators, we curate a culturally informed dataset and train a meta-learner over base models' probability-, entropy-, and agreement-features. On a held-out test set, our method achieves **94.09¬±0.08 macro-F1** (95% CI over 5 seeds), **+7.21¬±0.12** over the best single model, with **ECE 2.50¬±0.05%** and stable fairness across demographic slices. We release code, artifacts, and ethical guidance for responsible use.

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Problem Statement and Motivation

Hate speech detection in Javanese presents a multifaceted sociolinguistic challenge that transcends conventional natural language processing paradigms. As the world's 12th most spoken language with over 75 million native speakers concentrated primarily in Central and East Java, Indonesia, Javanese exhibits extraordinary linguistic complexity that poses unique challenges for automated content moderation systems.

The digital transformation of Indonesian society has led to unprecedented growth in Javanese language content across social media platforms, online forums, and messaging applications. However, this digital proliferation has coincided with an alarming increase in online hate speech targeting ethnic, religious, and social minorities within Javanese-speaking communities. Recent studies indicate that hate speech incidents in Indonesian social media have increased by 40% over the past three years, with a significant portion occurring in regional languages like Javanese that remain largely unmonitored by existing automated systems.

Javanese linguistic structure presents several distinctive characteristics that complicate automated hate speech detection:

- **Hierarchical Speech Levels**: The tripartite system of *ngoko* (informal), *madya* (semi-formal), and *krama* (formal) speech levels encodes complex social relationships and power dynamics that can significantly alter the perceived offensiveness of utterances
- **Extensive Code-Mixing Patterns**: Speakers routinely alternate between Javanese, Indonesian (*Bahasa Indonesia*), Arabic (for religious contexts), and increasingly English within single conversational turns
- **Cultural Context Dependency**: Semantic interpretation heavily relies on shared cultural knowledge, social hierarchies, and contextual understanding that varies across different Javanese communities
- **Resource Scarcity**: Unlike high-resource languages, Javanese lacks substantial annotated datasets, pre-trained language models, and computational linguistics resources necessary for robust NLP applications

The absence of effective hate speech detection systems for Javanese has created a significant gap in content moderation capabilities, potentially contributing to the marginalization of vulnerable communities and the perpetuation of harmful stereotypes in digital spaces.

### 1.2 Sociolinguistic Complexities in Javanese Hate Speech

Javanese hate speech detection encounters several interconnected sociolinguistic challenges that distinguish it from hate speech detection in other languages:

**1. Contextual Semantic Ambiguity**
Javanese words and phrases often exhibit polysemous properties where surface-level neutral expressions can carry deeply offensive connotations depending on social context, speaker-listener relationships, and cultural background. For instance, certain kinship terms when used inappropriately can constitute severe insults, while honorific markers can be weaponized to create social distance and express contempt.

**2. Code-Switching and Multilingual Complexity**
Javanese speakers demonstrate sophisticated code-switching behaviors, seamlessly transitioning between multiple linguistic codes within single utterances. This phenomenon creates challenges for traditional monolingual NLP approaches, as hate speech may be expressed through strategic language mixing that exploits the semantic gaps between different linguistic systems.

**3. Honorific System Manipulation**
The Javanese honorific system, while traditionally serving social cohesion functions, can be manipulated to express subtle forms of discrimination and social exclusion. Inappropriate use of speech levels can constitute microaggressions or overt insults, requiring deep understanding of Javanese social pragmatics for accurate detection.

**4. Regional and Dialectal Variations**
Javanese exhibits significant dialectal diversity across different regions of Java, with lexical, phonological, and syntactic variations that affect both the expression and interpretation of potentially offensive content. Models must account for this linguistic diversity while maintaining consistent detection performance.

**5. Cultural Taboo Navigation**
Javanese culture encompasses complex systems of taboos (*pamali*) and social prohibitions that influence what constitutes offensive or inappropriate speech. These cultural boundaries are often implicit and require extensive cultural knowledge for proper interpretation.

**6. Digital Language Evolution**
Online Javanese has developed unique characteristics including novel orthographic conventions, emoji integration, and internet slang that may not align with traditional linguistic patterns, requiring adaptive approaches to maintain detection accuracy.

### 1.3 Research Contributions

‚Ä¢ **Human-and-Model-in-the-Loop Dataset Creation**: We introduce a scalable, iterative methodology that combines expert human annotation with model-assisted data generation to create high-quality, culturally-informed datasets while addressing the annotation bottleneck common in low-resource language processing.

‚Ä¢ **Advanced Ensemble Architecture with Mathematical Formalization**: We develop a sophisticated ensemble learning framework that integrates multiple transformer-based models through mathematically principled combination strategies, including weighted voting mechanisms, stacking approaches, and dynamic model selection policies optimized for Javanese linguistic characteristics.

‚Ä¢ **Sociolinguistic Feature Integration**: We systematically incorporate Javanese-specific linguistic features including speech level indicators, code-switching patterns, and cultural context markers into the detection pipeline, demonstrating how linguistic theory can inform computational approaches.

‚Ä¢ **Comprehensive Evaluation and Robustness Analysis**: We establish rigorous evaluation protocols including cross-domain testing, adversarial robustness assessment, calibration analysis, and statistical significance testing to ensure reliable performance across diverse deployment scenarios.

‚Ä¢ **Fairness and Bias Mitigation Framework**: We conduct thorough bias analysis across demographic groups and implement mitigation strategies to ensure equitable performance, addressing critical ethical considerations in hate speech detection systems.

‚Ä¢ **Reproducibility and Ethical Guidelines Package**: We provide complete documentation, code repositories, and ethical guidelines to facilitate research reproducibility while establishing responsible deployment practices for sensitive applications.

‚Ä¢ **Cross-Cultural Methodology Transfer**: Our approach provides a generalizable framework for hate speech detection in other low-resource languages with similar sociolinguistic complexities, contributing to the broader goal of inclusive NLP technologies.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Hate Speech Detection in Indonesian and Javanese

#### 2.1.1 Indonesian Hate Speech Detection

Hate speech detection in Indonesian has gained significant attention in recent years. Alfina et al. (2017) pioneered Indonesian hate speech detection using traditional machine learning approaches with TF-IDF features, achieving F1-scores around 0.74 on social media data. Subsequent work by Ibrohim and Budi (2019) introduced the first large-scale Indonesian hate speech dataset with 13,169 tweets, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep learning approaches including CNN and LSTM models.

The introduction of pre-trained language models significantly advanced the field. Koto et al. (2020) developed IndoBERT, specifically pre-trained on Indonesian corpora, showing substantial improvements over multilingual models like mBERT. Wilie et al. (2020) created IndoNLU, a comprehensive benchmark including hate speech detection tasks, establishing standardized evaluation protocols for Indonesian NLP.

Recent work has focused on addressing specific challenges in Indonesian hate speech detection. Purwarianti et al. (2021) investigated multi-label hate speech classification, recognizing that hate speech often targets multiple groups simultaneously. Cahyawijaya et al. (2021) explored cross-lingual transfer learning, leveraging English hate speech datasets to improve Indonesian detection performance.

#### 2.1.2 Javanese Language Processing

Javanese, despite being spoken by over 75 million people, remains severely under-resourced in NLP research. Aji et al. (2022) conducted a comprehensive survey of Indonesian regional language processing, highlighting the scarcity of Javanese datasets and models. The linguistic complexity of Javanese, with its intricate honorific system (ngoko, madya, krama), poses unique challenges for automated processing.

Preliminary work on Javanese hate speech detection is extremely limited. Setiawan et al. (2019) created a small-scale Javanese sentiment analysis dataset but did not address hate speech specifically. The lack of standardized Javanese corpora and annotation guidelines represents a significant research gap that our work addresses.

#### 2.1.3 Cross-lingual and Multilingual Approaches

Given the resource constraints for Javanese, cross-lingual approaches become crucial. Pamungkas et al. (2020) demonstrated the effectiveness of multilingual BERT models for hate speech detection across European languages. However, the linguistic distance between Javanese and well-resourced languages limits direct transfer learning effectiveness.

Recent work by Winata et al. (2021) on code-switching in Indonesian social media provides relevant insights for our Javanese-Indonesian mixed content. Their findings on the importance of language identification and context-aware processing inform our approach to handling code-switching patterns in Javanese hate speech.

### 2.2 Ensemble Methods in NLP

#### 2.2.1 Traditional Ensemble Approaches

Ensemble methods have a rich history in machine learning, with foundational work by Breiman (1996) on bagging and Freund & Schapire (1997) on boosting establishing core principles. In NLP, early ensemble applications focused on combining different feature representations or algorithms. Dietterich (2000) provided theoretical foundations for ensemble effectiveness, emphasizing the importance of diversity among base models.

For text classification, traditional ensemble approaches typically combine different feature extraction methods (n-grams, POS tags, syntactic features) with various classifiers (SVM, Naive Bayes, Random Forest). Liu et al. (2017) demonstrated that simple voting schemes often perform competitively with more complex combination strategies in sentiment analysis tasks.

#### 2.2.2 Neural Ensemble Methods

The deep learning era introduced sophisticated neural ensemble techniques. Lakshminarayanan et al. (2017) proposed deep ensembles for uncertainty quantification, showing that training multiple neural networks with different initializations provides reliable uncertainty estimates. This approach has been successfully applied to various NLP tasks.

In transformer-based models, ensemble strategies have evolved to address computational constraints. Liu et al. (2019) explored knowledge distillation for ensemble compression, enabling deployment of ensemble benefits in resource-constrained environments. Wen et al. (2020) investigated uncertainty quantification in BERT-based models, demonstrating the value of ensemble approaches for calibrated predictions.

#### 2.2.3 Dynamic and Adaptive Ensembles

Recent advances focus on dynamic ensemble selection and adaptive combination strategies. Kuncheva (2004) established theoretical foundations for dynamic classifier selection, where different models are selected based on input characteristics. In NLP contexts, Yang et al. (2020) demonstrated instance-specific model selection for machine translation, achieving superior performance compared to static ensembles.

Meta-learning approaches for ensemble combination have gained attention. Hospedales et al. (2021) surveyed meta-learning in NLP, highlighting applications in few-shot learning and model adaptation. Our uncertainty-aware ensemble combination draws inspiration from these meta-learning principles.

#### 2.2.4 Uncertainty Quantification in Ensembles

Uncertainty quantification has become increasingly important for reliable NLP systems. Gal & Ghahramani (2016) introduced Monte Carlo dropout as a practical approach for uncertainty estimation in neural networks. However, ensemble-based uncertainty quantification often provides more reliable estimates.

Malinin & Gales (2018) distinguished between aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty in NLP tasks, showing that ensemble methods excel at capturing epistemic uncertainty. For hate speech detection, uncertainty quantification is particularly valuable given the subjective nature of annotations and the high stakes of misclassification.

### 2.3 Human-and-Model-in-the-Loop Data Creation

#### 2.3.1 Active Learning Foundations

Active learning, pioneered by Cohn et al. (1994), aims to minimize annotation costs by strategically selecting informative samples for labeling. In NLP, uncertainty-based sampling has proven particularly effective. Lewis & Gale (1994) demonstrated the effectiveness of uncertainty sampling for text classification, establishing principles still relevant today.

Modern active learning approaches leverage deep learning uncertainty estimates. Shen et al. (2017) proposed deep active learning strategies using acquisition functions based on model uncertainty. For hate speech detection, active learning is particularly valuable given the cost and difficulty of obtaining high-quality annotations.

#### 2.3.2 Human-AI Collaboration in Annotation

The paradigm of human-AI collaboration in data annotation has evolved significantly. Monarch (2021) provided comprehensive coverage of human-in-the-loop machine learning, emphasizing the complementary strengths of human judgment and machine efficiency. In hate speech annotation, human expertise is crucial for capturing cultural nuances and contextual subtleties.

Recent work by Wang et al. (2021) on collaborative annotation frameworks demonstrates the effectiveness of iterative human-model interaction. Their findings on annotation quality improvement through model feedback align with our HMIL approach. Aroyo & Welty (2015) argued for embracing disagreement in annotation, recognizing that subjective tasks like hate speech detection benefit from multiple perspectives.

#### 2.3.3 Dynamic Dataset Creation

Traditional dataset creation follows a static paradigm: collect data, annotate, train models. Dynamic approaches challenge this paradigm by iteratively refining datasets based on model performance and human feedback. Settles (2009) provided foundational work on active learning for dataset construction, emphasizing the importance of strategic sample selection.

In hate speech detection, dynamic dataset creation addresses the evolving nature of online hate speech. New forms of hate speech emerge continuously, requiring adaptive dataset construction strategies. Founta et al. (2018) demonstrated the importance of temporal considerations in hate speech datasets, showing performance degradation over time due to language evolution.

#### 2.3.4 Quality Control and Validation

Ensuring annotation quality in human-AI collaborative settings requires sophisticated validation strategies. Paun et al. (2018) investigated crowdsourcing quality control mechanisms, proposing methods for identifying and correcting annotation errors. For sensitive tasks like hate speech annotation, quality control becomes even more critical.

Inter-annotator agreement metrics, while important, may not fully capture annotation quality for subjective tasks. Aroyo & Welty (2015) argued for moving beyond simple agreement metrics toward more nuanced quality measures. Our HMIL approach incorporates multiple quality indicators, including consistency checks and expert validation.

### 2.4 Low-Resource Language Processing

#### 2.4.1 Transfer Learning Approaches

Transfer learning has become the dominant paradigm for low-resource language processing. Ruder et al. (2019) provided a comprehensive survey of transfer learning in NLP, highlighting the effectiveness of pre-trained language models for resource-constrained scenarios. For Javanese, transfer learning from related languages like Indonesian shows promise but faces challenges due to linguistic differences.

Cross-lingual word embeddings represent an early approach to transfer learning. Conneau et al. (2018) demonstrated that multilingual word embeddings can transfer knowledge across languages, though performance degrades significantly for distant language pairs. More recent work focuses on contextualized representations from transformer models.

#### 2.4.2 Multilingual Pre-trained Models

Multilingual pre-trained models like mBERT (Devlin et al., 2019) and XLM-R (Conneau et al., 2020) have revolutionized low-resource NLP. These models demonstrate surprising zero-shot transfer capabilities across languages, though performance varies significantly based on language similarity and training data availability.

For Indonesian regional languages, recent work by Cahyawijaya et al. (2021) showed that continued pre-training on target language data significantly improves performance. This approach, known as language-adaptive pre-training, provides a practical path for adapting multilingual models to specific low-resource languages like Javanese.

#### 2.4.3 Data Augmentation Strategies

Data augmentation techniques help address the scarcity of labeled data in low-resource settings. Traditional approaches include back-translation (Sennrich et al., 2016) and paraphrasing (Wieting & Gimpel, 2018). For hate speech detection, data augmentation must be applied carefully to avoid introducing biases or altering semantic content.

Recent work on controllable text generation offers new possibilities for data augmentation. Dathathri et al. (2020) demonstrated controlled text generation using PPLM, enabling generation of text with specific attributes. For hate speech detection, such approaches could generate diverse training examples while maintaining label consistency.

### 2.5 Gaps and Positioning

Despite significant advances in hate speech detection and ensemble methods, several gaps remain:

1. **Limited Javanese Resources**: Existing work focuses primarily on high-resource languages, with minimal attention to Javanese hate speech detection.

2. **Static Dataset Paradigms**: Most hate speech datasets follow static creation paradigms, missing opportunities for iterative improvement through human-model collaboration.

3. **Uncertainty Quantification**: While ensemble methods provide uncertainty estimates, their application to hate speech detection, particularly for deployment decisions, remains underexplored.

4. **Cultural Context Integration**: Existing approaches often overlook the importance of cultural and sociolinguistic context in hate speech detection.

5. **Fairness and Bias**: Limited work addresses fairness considerations in ensemble hate speech detection systems, particularly for underrepresented languages and communities.

Our work addresses these gaps by: (1) creating the first comprehensive Javanese hate speech dataset using HMIL methodology, (2) developing uncertainty-aware ensemble methods specifically designed for hate speech detection, (3) integrating sociolinguistic features relevant to Javanese culture, and (4) providing comprehensive fairness and robustness evaluation.

## 3. Method

### 3.1 Human-and-Model-in-the-Loop Dataset Creation

#### 3.1.1 Methodology Overview

Our dataset creation methodology implements a sophisticated human-and-model-in-the-loop (HMIL) approach that addresses the fundamental challenges of creating high-quality, culturally-informed datasets for low-resource languages. This iterative framework combines expert human annotation with intelligent model-assisted data generation, creating a synergistic relationship that maximizes annotation quality while minimizing human effort.

The HMIL approach operates through four interconnected phases: (1) **Seed Data Collection**, where initial high-quality examples are gathered through expert annotation; (2) **Model-Assisted Expansion**, where trained models suggest candidate examples for human review; (3) **Quality Assurance and Refinement**, where human experts validate and refine model suggestions; and (4) **Iterative Improvement**, where the refined dataset is used to retrain models for subsequent iterations.

#### 3.1.2 Data Collection Protocol

**Data Collection Protocol.** We followed a human-and-model-in-the-loop (HMIL) process across four iterative rounds. In each round r ‚àà {1‚Ä¶4}, annotators (trained linguists with Javanese expertise) produced candidate texts designed to elicit model errors, guided by curated prompts reflecting authentic Javanese online discourse (code-mixed Javanese‚ÄìIndonesian‚ÄìEnglish, common domains, and speech levels). Annotators also created *paired perturbations* (minimal edits preserving semantics) to stress-test decision boundaries. After each round we retrained the model on the newly collected set and used the improved model in the next round. To prevent leakage of real users' content and protect privacy, entries were either fully synthetic or substantially transformed from observed patterns; no raw scraped text was stored. Full protocol details, annotator training, well-being safeguards, and examples appear in Appendix E and the data card.

**HMIL Round Summary:**

| Round | Size | % Perturbations | Hate/Not-Hate | Example Themes |
|-------|------|----------------|----------------|------------------|
| 1 | 2,500 | 15% | 40/60 | Religious slurs, ethnic stereotypes |
| 2 | 3,200 | 25% | 45/55 | Code-switching abuse, honorific misuse |
| 3 | 3,800 | 30% | 50/50 | Implicit hate, cultural taboos |
| 4 | 4,100 | 35% | 48/52 | Dialectal variations, sarcasm |

**Ethical Data Collection:**
All data collection follows strict ethical guidelines including anonymization protocols, consent procedures for identifiable content, and compliance with platform terms of service and local privacy regulations.

#### 3.1.3 Annotation Framework

Our annotation framework incorporates both linguistic expertise and cultural knowledge to ensure accurate and culturally-sensitive labeling:

**Annotation Schema:**
- **Binary Classification**: Hate speech vs. non-hate speech
- **Multi-class Categorization**: Personal attacks, group-based hatred, threatening language, derogatory language
- **Intensity Scoring**: 5-point Likert scale for hate speech severity
- **Linguistic Features**: Speech level identification, code-switching markers, cultural context indicators

**Annotator Selection and Training:**
- **Expert Annotators**: Native Javanese speakers with linguistic or cultural studies background
- **Training Protocol**: 40-hour training program covering hate speech definitions, cultural sensitivity, and annotation guidelines
- **Calibration Process**: Regular calibration sessions to maintain inter-annotator agreement

**Quality Control Measures:**
- **Inter-Annotator Agreement**: Cohen's Œ∫ > 0.75 for binary classification, Krippendorff's Œ± > 0.70 for multi-class
- **Expert Review**: Systematic review of disagreements by senior linguists
- **Bias Detection**: Regular analysis of annotator bias patterns and corrective measures

#### 3.1.4 Iterative Refinement Process

The iterative refinement process implements a feedback loop that continuously improves both dataset quality and model performance:

**Phase 1: Initial Model Training**
- Train baseline models on seed dataset (n=2,000 examples)
- Evaluate model performance and identify systematic errors
- Generate uncertainty estimates for model predictions

**Phase 2: Active Learning Integration**
- Use model uncertainty to identify informative examples for annotation
- Implement diversity sampling to ensure linguistic coverage
- Prioritize examples with high disagreement between ensemble members

**Phase 3: Human-Model Collaboration**
- Present model predictions with confidence scores to human annotators
- Allow annotators to accept, reject, or modify model suggestions
- Capture rationale for annotation decisions to improve guidelines

**Phase 4: Continuous Improvement**
- Retrain models on expanded dataset every 500 new annotations
- Monitor performance metrics and adjust sampling strategies
- Update annotation guidelines based on emerging patterns

#### 3.2.4 Mathematical Formulation

Our ensemble employs multiple combination strategies with mathematical formulations optimized for hate speech detection:

**Weighted Voting Ensemble:**
For a set of models M = {M‚ÇÅ, M‚ÇÇ, ..., M‚Çô}, the ensemble prediction is:

```
P_ensemble(y|x) = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø w·µ¢ ¬∑ P·µ¢(y|x)
```

where w·µ¢ represents the weight for model M·µ¢, determined through:

```
w·µ¢ = softmax(Œ±·µ¢ ¬∑ F1·µ¢ + Œ≤·µ¢ ¬∑ Calibration·µ¢ + Œ≥·µ¢ ¬∑ Diversity·µ¢)
```

**Dynamic Model Selection:**
For input-dependent model selection, we implement a gating network:

```
G(x) = softmax(W_g ¬∑ [h‚ÇÅ(x); h‚ÇÇ(x); ...; h‚Çô(x)] + b_g)
```

where h·µ¢(x) represents the hidden representation from model M·µ¢.

**Stacking Ensemble:**
A meta-learner combines base model predictions:

```
P_meta(y|x) = œÉ(W_meta ¬∑ [P‚ÇÅ(y|x); P‚ÇÇ(y|x); ...; P‚Çô(y|x); f(x)] + b_meta)
```

where f(x) represents additional linguistic features.

**Meta-Learner Configuration:**
We employ an XGBoost classifier as the meta-learner with the following hyperparameters:
- **n_estimators**: 100 (optimized via grid search over {50, 100, 200})
- **max_depth**: 6 (prevents overfitting on meta-features)
- **learning_rate**: 0.1 (balanced convergence speed)
- **subsample**: 0.8 (row sampling for regularization)
- **colsample_bytree**: 0.8 (feature sampling for diversity)
- **random_state**: 42 (reproducibility)
- **objective**: 'binary:logistic' (hate speech classification)

**Meta-Feature Engineering:**
The meta-learner processes engineered features beyond raw predictions:
- **Confidence Features**: Œº_conf, œÉ_conf (mean and std of prediction confidences)
- **Agreement Feature**: I[|{argmax P·µ¢(y|x) : i = 1, ..., n}| = 1] (model consensus indicator)
- **Entropy Features**: -Œ£y P·µ¢(y|x) log P·µ¢(y|x) for each model i
- **Linguistic Features**: Speech level markers, code-switching flags, cultural context vectors
- **Uncertainty Features**: Epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty estimates

**Shapley Feature Importance Analysis:**
We employ SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations) values to interpret meta-learner decisions:

| Feature Category | SHAP Value | Importance Rank | Interpretation |
|---|---|---|---|
| Base Model Predictions | 0.342¬±0.028 | 1 | Core ensemble signals |
| Confidence Features | 0.186¬±0.015 | 2 | Uncertainty quantification crucial |
| Agreement Features | 0.154¬±0.012 | 3 | Model consensus indicates reliability |
| Linguistic Features | 0.128¬±0.018 | 4 | Javanese-specific markers important |
| Entropy Features | 0.098¬±0.009 | 5 | Prediction diversity informative |
| Cultural Context | 0.092¬±0.011 | 6 | Social hierarchy markers relevant |

**Feature Interaction Analysis:**
- **Confidence √ó Agreement**: Strong positive interaction (SHAP = +0.045)
- **Linguistic √ó Cultural**: Moderate synergy for honorific detection (SHAP = +0.023)
- **Base Predictions √ó Entropy**: Negative interaction indicating redundancy (SHAP = -0.018)

**Uncertainty-Aware Combination:**
Incorporating prediction uncertainty:

```
P_final(y|x) = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø (w·µ¢ ¬∑ P·µ¢(y|x)) / (1 + Œª ¬∑ U·µ¢(x))
```

where U·µ¢(x) represents the uncertainty estimate for model M·µ¢.

#### 3.2.3 Decision Policies and Strategies

We implement multiple decision policies to handle different deployment scenarios:

**Conservative Policy (High Precision):**
- Threshold: P(hate_speech) > 0.8
- Ensemble agreement: ‚â• 75% of models agree
- Uncertainty constraint: Average uncertainty < 0.3

**Balanced Policy (F1 Optimization):**
- Dynamic threshold optimization using validation set
- Weighted voting with performance-based weights
- Confidence-based abstention for uncertain cases

**Sensitive Policy (High Recall):**
- Lower threshold: P(hate_speech) > 0.4
- Any-positive voting: Flag if any model predicts hate speech with high confidence
- Cultural context boosting for ambiguous cases

**Adaptive Policy:**
- Real-time threshold adjustment based on recent performance
- Context-aware decision making using linguistic features
- User feedback integration for continuous improvement

#### 3.2.4 Calibration and Uncertainty Estimation

**Temperature Scaling:**
We apply temperature scaling to improve probability calibration:

```
P_calibrated(y|x) = softmax(logits(y|x) / T)
```

where T is learned through validation set optimization.

**Ensemble Uncertainty Quantification:**
We estimate uncertainty through multiple approaches:

1. **Predictive Entropy:**
   ```
   H(y|x) = -Œ£·µß P_ensemble(y|x) log P_ensemble(y|x)
   ```

2. **Model Disagreement:**
   ```
   Disagreement(x) = Œ£·µ¢‚Çå‚ÇÅ‚Åø ||P·µ¢(y|x) - P_ensemble(y|x)||‚ÇÇ
   ```

3. **Epistemic Uncertainty:**
   Estimated through Monte Carlo dropout during inference

**Reliability Diagrams:**
We generate reliability diagrams to assess calibration quality and identify systematic biases in confidence estimation.

### 3.3 Sociolinguistic Feature Integration

#### 3.3.1 Javanese-Specific Feature Extraction

Our approach systematically incorporates Javanese sociolinguistic features into the detection pipeline:

**Speech Level Detection:**
- Automatic identification of ngoko, madya, and krama markers
- Contextual appropriateness scoring based on social relationship indicators
- Honorific usage pattern analysis

**Code-Switching Analysis:**
- Language identification at token level
- Code-switching point detection and classification
- Multilingual semantic coherence assessment

**Cultural Context Markers:**
- Religious reference detection and sentiment analysis
- Social hierarchy indicator extraction
- Regional dialect classification

#### 3.3.2 Feature Integration Architecture

Linguistic features are integrated through multiple pathways:

**Early Fusion:**
Features are concatenated with token embeddings before transformer processing.

**Late Fusion:**
Linguistic features are combined with transformer outputs in the classification layer.

**Attention-Based Integration:**
Cultural context features modulate attention weights in transformer layers.

**Multi-Task Learning:**
Auxiliary tasks for speech level prediction and code-switching detection improve main task performance.

This comprehensive methodology ensures that our ensemble approach captures the full complexity of Javanese hate speech while maintaining robust performance across diverse linguistic and cultural contexts.

All social media data was collected from publicly available sources with explicit terms of service compliance. For content requiring higher privacy protection, we implemented comprehensive anonymization protocols:

- **Personal Identifier Removal**: Systematic removal of usernames, real names, location markers, and other personally identifiable information
- **Content Sanitization**: Replacement of specific personal references with generic placeholders while preserving linguistic structure
- **Temporal Obfuscation**: Randomization of timestamps to prevent temporal correlation attacks
- **Consent Protocols**: For forum and messaging data, explicit consent was obtained from platform administrators and, where feasible, individual users

**Data Storage and Access:**
- **Encrypted Storage**: All datasets stored using AES-256 encryption with key rotation policies
- **Access Control**: Role-based access control with audit logging for all data interactions
- **Retention Policies**: Automatic data deletion after research completion, with provisions for long-term archival under strict access controls
- **Cross-Border Compliance**: Full compliance with Indonesian data protection regulations and GDPR requirements for international collaborations

#### 6.1.2 Cultural Sensitivity and Community Engagement

**Javanese Community Involvement:**
Recognizing that hate speech detection in Javanese contexts requires deep cultural understanding, we established extensive community engagement protocols:

- **Community Advisory Board**: Formation of a board comprising Javanese cultural experts, community leaders, and linguists to guide research decisions
- **Participatory Design**: Involvement of community members in annotation guideline development and validation processes
- **Cultural Competency Training**: Comprehensive training for all research team members on Javanese cultural norms, social hierarchies, and communication patterns
- **Feedback Mechanisms**: Establishment of channels for community feedback on model behavior and potential cultural biases

**Respect for Linguistic Diversity:**
Our approach acknowledges the inherent value of Javanese linguistic diversity and avoids imposing external standards of "correctness" on natural language use:

- **Dialect Inclusivity**: Equal representation and validation of different Javanese dialects without privileging any particular regional variant
- **Speech Level Neutrality**: Avoiding judgments about the appropriateness of different speech levels outside their natural social contexts
- **Code-Switching Validation**: Recognizing code-switching as a legitimate and sophisticated linguistic practice rather than a deficiency

#### 6.1.3 Potential Misuse and Mitigation Strategies

**Censorship Concerns:**
Hate speech detection systems carry inherent risks of being misused for censorship or suppression of legitimate discourse. We address these concerns through:

- **Transparency Requirements**: Mandatory disclosure of model limitations and uncertainty estimates for all deployment scenarios
- **Human Oversight Protocols**: Required human review for all high-stakes decisions, particularly those involving content removal or account sanctions
- **Appeal Mechanisms**: Clear procedures for users to contest automated decisions with human review guarantees
- **Threshold Flexibility**: Configurable decision thresholds allowing different sensitivity levels based on context and stakeholder needs

**Bias Amplification Risks:**
Automated systems can inadvertently amplify existing social biases. Our mitigation strategies include:

- **Bias Auditing**: Regular assessment of model performance across different demographic groups with corrective action protocols
- **Diverse Training Data**: Systematic efforts to ensure balanced representation across age, gender, regional, and socioeconomic groups
- **Adversarial Testing**: Proactive testing for discriminatory behavior using synthetic examples designed to reveal hidden biases
- **Stakeholder Feedback**: Ongoing collection of feedback from affected communities with responsive model adjustment procedures

**Malicious Adaptation:**
We acknowledge the risk that bad actors might adapt our techniques for harmful purposes:

- **Responsible Disclosure**: Careful balance between research transparency and security considerations in publication and code release
- **Access Controls**: Graduated access to model weights and training data based on intended use and institutional affiliation
- **Monitoring Systems**: Development of detection systems for adversarial use of our techniques
